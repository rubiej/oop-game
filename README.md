Project Brief
The aim of this project is to create a text based adventure game using Object Oriented
Programming techniques in JavaScript
Extra bragging rights will be awarded for creativity in the subject and presentation of your game.
Your Project
The game should be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game should include the
following functionality:
1. A Single HTML page. The user should not move from the page when playing the
game.
2. The ability to move around the game to different “rooms”.
3. The display of a description of the room when the adventurer enters the room.
4. The display of a description of any objects or characters who are in the room.
5. The ability to interact with characters and /or objects / rooms in the game (e.g. fight a
character, solve a puzzle, collect an object).
6. The ability to “loose” the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a
character, object or room).
7. The ability to “win” the game if certain conditions occur (e.g. in interaction with a
character, object or room).
Deliverables
The address for the GitHub repository.
The address for the GitHub pages.
Extension
Create a win condition that is dependent on several actions during the game (defeat several
enemy characters, collect objects from friendly characters and defeat a final “boss” character)
Reuse the classes and methods to create a second game in a different setting (the second
game could be much simpler and only include navigation around the setting).Week 3 Project
